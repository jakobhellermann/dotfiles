- use context7 mcp server to look up-to-date info, docs and versions
- don't guess my intentions, ask for clarifications if necessary
- before removing or changing asserts, think about whether the actual code should change instead or ask me
- never commit to vcs or do destructive actions without asking first
- comments always in english, even if i talk in german
- prefer asserting full matches, i.e. assertEqual instead of assering not empty or contains
- instead of piping long-running processes directly to grep, tee them to a file and grep afterwards
